# Web Monitor

Web app to monitorize web sites and catch when they are down

## Motivation

This app was created to monitorize web pages sending them an HTTP Request to them. This was for a friend who needed it and I'm going to try keep this updated.

## Technologies

- **Golang**. Used in the backend to handle all the app logic 
- **VueJS**. Used with its CDN to make the app more responsive and dynamic

## How to use the app?

1. Download the binary for your OS: _Windows_ or _Linux_
2. Put the executable in any path you want, juts make sure you have writting and reading permissions in there
3. Double-click the file. A terminal/cmd window will be opened. **DON'T CLOSE IT**
4. Open your favorite internet browser
5. Go to http://localhost:7890
6. Accept notifications permission

You're ready to go!

## Important

- You must not move the executable to other location. The saved data can be lost.
- Linux executable might work on MacOS
- This app has been tested in Chrome, Brave and Firefox browsers, but just in the first two it works.
